/**
 * @skill resolving-an-identifier
 * @verb-phrase resolving an identifier
 * @closure-kind process
 * @description Resolves an identifier — a bare kebab slug or an emsenn/<kind>/<slug> namespaced string — to the pool(s) that could hold it and the file(s) actually seated there, under one documented resolution law that names its two legitimate strategies rather than picking a winner and breaking the other. Exports resolveIdentifier (and its parts) as a module for siblings to import, and serves the identical resolution as a CLI. Use wherever an instrument currently re-derives "where does this id seat" by hand instead of asking the one place that answers it.
 *
 * @precondition ref is a non-empty string, either kebab-case or emsenn/<kind>/<slug>
 * @precondition a kind is available, either parsed from ref or given explicitly
 * @precondition strategy, when given, is nearest or global
 * @postcondition the same (ref, kind, from, root, strategy) always resolves to the same pools and seats — resolution is a pure function of its inputs and the filesystem, never of which instrument asked
 * @postcondition nearest resolution walks UP from the asking point and never reads below the unit it lands on
 * @postcondition global resolution walks DOWN from root and never shadows one venture's seat with another's
 * @witness the parsed kind and slug, the strategy used, every pool it looked in, and every seat it found
 * @witness on refusal, which precondition was unmet
 *
 * ## The disagreement this module ends, by naming it rather than erasing it
 *
 * Before this module, three instruments independently converged on ONE answer
 * to "where do MY records for kind K live": write-an-office.js's
 * findUnitRoot+poolsOf, report-an-anomaly.js's findUnit+anomalyPool, and
 * raise-an-idea.js's findUnitRoot+ideasPool all walk UP from the asking point
 * to the nearest ancestor carrying content/ or lib/management/, then read
 * content/<kind> if it exists, else lib/management/<kind>. Three instruments
 * arriving at the identical rule without coordinating is strong evidence it
 * is the right default, so it is this module's NEAREST strategy and its
 * default.
 *
 * Two other instruments — dispatch-a-task.js's officeSeats and
 * list-open-obligations.js's officeSeats — walk DOWN from the repo root,
 * collecting every offices/ directory in the whole tree that holds the id.
 * This is not the same question with a different answer; it is a genuinely
 * different question. write-an-office.js's own header says why nearest
 * cannot answer it: "executive-assistant names the 561 Group's office inside
 * the 561 Group and emsenn's inside emsenn's tree" — office ids intentionally
 * repeat across ventures, and "does an office of this id exist ANYWHERE, so a
 * dispatch to it is not a dispatch to nobody" has to search the whole tree,
 * not shadow one venture's seat with the nearest one. That is this module's
 * GLOBAL strategy, preserved as an explicit, named, opt-in mode rather than
 * silently dropped to make the two camps look like one.
 *
 * The anomalies naming this conflict —
 * office-resolution-disagrees-across-instruments and
 * write-a-term-and-write-a-schema-resolve-pools-by-different-strategies —
 * are retired not by declaring one strategy wrong, but by giving both a
 * single, shared, tested implementation, so a future disagreement is a merge
 * conflict in one file instead of five files quietly drifting apart.
 *
 * A third case, decision-records-pool-split-across-two-seats, is neither of
 * the above: content/decision-records and lib/management/decision-records
 * are BOTH simultaneously live inside one unit (emsenn), and neither may
 * shadow the other the way legacy pools ordinarily do — supersede-a-task.js's
 * DECISION_POOLS already scans both, every call. This module carries that as
 * multiSeat: true, a per-kind override on the NEAREST strategy that scans
 * and merges content/<kind> and lib/management/<kind> instead of the first
 * shadowing the second. It is not a third strategy; it is a documented
 * exception inside the first one, on the one kind that currently needs it.
 *
 * ## What resolution answers, and what it refuses to answer
 *
 * This module answers "which pool(s), and which seated file(s), for this
 * id" — nothing about whether the record found there is well-formed (that is
 * reading-a-schema.js's job) and nothing about which of several ties should
 * win when a caller needs ONE answer (that is write-an-office.js's own
 * resolveFrom, scoped to its own reciprocal-edge bookkeeping and left there
 * rather than folded in here, because "nearest by shared path prefix among
 * globally-collected candidates" is a third question again — disambiguating
 * among ties the referrer's own position, not resolving an id at all).
 *
 * ## Run it
 *
 * ```sh
 * node .../resolve-an-identifier.js office --kind offices --global --root <repo>
 * node .../resolve-an-identifier.js emsenn/idea/adopt-public-standard-protocols --from <dir>
 * node .../resolve-an-identifier.js decision-records-pool-split-across-two-seats --kind decision-records --multi-seat --from <dir>
 * ```
 *
 * As a module:
 *
 * ```js
 * import { resolveIdentifier } from ".../resolve-an-identifier.js";
 * const hit = resolveIdentifier("executive-assistant", { kind: "offices", strategy: "global", root });
 * ```
 *
 * Output is JSON. `--from` (default: the caller's working directory) is
 * where nearest resolution starts; `--root` (default: the caller's working
 * directory) is where global resolution starts. Neither is ever guessed from
 * `git rev-parse` — a node may be a submodule, so the enclosing git toplevel
 * says nothing about where a UNIT's own pools are.
 *
 * ## What it refuses, and why that is the skill
 *
 * - **An empty or non-string ref** — refused. Nothing to resolve.
 * - **A bare slug with no --kind, and no emsenn/<kind>/<slug> to parse one
 *   from** — refused. A slug alone does not say which pool it lives in;
 *   guessing would be a second, worse answer to the exact question this
 *   module exists to give one answer to.
 * - **A strategy that is neither nearest nor global** — refused, named.
 *
 * It does NOT refuse an id that resolves to nothing — that is a normal,
 * witnessed outcome (`seats: []`), not an error; the caller decides whether
 * an unseated id is fine (checking existence) or fatal (dereferencing it).
 *
 * ## When NOT to use
 *
 * - Not for validating a record's shape once resolved — reading-a-schema.js.
 * - Not for disambiguating a true tie by the referrer's own position —
 *   write-an-office.js's resolveFrom remains that instrument's own, narrower
 *   concern.
 * - Not for finding a SIBLING SCRIPT (read-a-schema.js, make-a-task.js) —
 *   that is a different resolution question again (a skill projected into a
 *   node vs. a pool record seated in one), answered by each script's own
 *   findSkill/sibling helper, which this module does not attempt to absorb.
